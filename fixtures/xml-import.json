         "abstract":"The development of the various strategies for the synthesis of optically active compounds in high enantiomeric excess has made great advances over the last decade or so (p. 15). Nevertheless, resolution is still necessary to prepare optically\npure chiral auxiliaries, to purify products of low enantiomeric excess and as a valid strategy for chiral synthesis in its own right. The most important general procedure for such resolutions, originally proposed and explored by Pasteur, involves\nthe conversion of the mixture of enantiomers into a pair of diastereoisomeric derivatives by reaction with a pure, optically active, reagent. It should be recalled that whereas the enantiomers in the mixture (or racemate) (1) have identical physical properties (except for their action on the plane of polarised light), the diastereoisomers (2) and (3) have physical properties (e.g. solubility, boiling points, chromatographic behaviour, etc.) which are frequently significantly different. Resolution of the mixture (or racemate) can then be achieved provided that one of the diastereoisomers may be obtained in a pure state, and that regeneration from it of the pure enantiomorphous form is not accompanied by any degree of racemisation.",

Biaxially drawn porous films possessing a porosity of over 80% for A > 3 are composed of a network of uniaxially oriented fibrils similar to biaxially drawn non-porous films. However, the fibrils in the porous films possess a fibre texture whereas in the non-porous films a mixed (100) and (110) texture can be observed. Both the Young's modulus and the tensile strength of porous biaxially drawn films are relatively poor compared to the tensile properties of non-porous films. This is due to the modulus being\ngoverned by the deformation of a loose fibrillar network, rather than by the properties of the fibrils. The tensile strength is reduced by the inhomogeneous structure and additionally by the non-uniaxial orientation of the fibrils when the film fractures.",

Bare Die FC packages leave the non active side of the die exposed. This allows the Customer to apply their preferred heat dissipation scheme during board level attach. Lidded FC packages use a\nmetallic lid, attached to the die. The lid can be flat or formed. Each of these packaging configurations has their advantages as well as disadvantages. For example, for the lidded package, keep out areas are required to leave enough room to attach the formed lid. For Bare Die packages, there is a die size limitation, otherwise warpage of the Bare Die package can exceed the JEDEC requirement for medium size die >/= 15mm (especially with thin core substrates).\n\nIn this work, we will discuss a new packaging concept, molded FC or FCMBGA, uses molding compound or molded underfill, MUF, instead of capillary underfill, CUF, for both protecting the FC die as well as eliminating the need for a lid. We will show this new package construction provides better package warpage control, especially for thin core substrates and enhanced reliability for passive components.

Similar trends can be observed in other parts of the world.\n\nOne of the reasons for this remarkable growth is the development in electric arc furnace design and operating practice, which has increased the productivity almost threefold during the past decade. Another reason are the relatively low capital costs compared to the traditional integrated route. This also stimulated many integrated steelmakers, who are faced with high capital costs in modernizing the front end of their operation and complying with the Clean Air Act Regulations, to look at electric arc furnaces as an alternative to traditional steelmaking technology. A further growth in EAF steelmaking was initiated by the development of thin slab casting and near net shape casting.",

         "abstract":"Introduction\n\nResearch and development of methods to utilize remote sensing as a means of monitoring onset and progress of foliar diseases of barley have been progressing since 1975. A low-cost, simple muitispectral radiometer was built by which reflected solar\nradiation could be measured in several narrow band wavelengths from 500 to 850 nm. The radiometer ls particularly useful as an objective and efficient means of measuring the progress of diseases for epidemiology studies of foliar diseases of barley. !t\nappears to be a more accurate method of measuring disease severities and for estimating the affect of foliar diseases on yleid and quality parameters than the visual assessment method. The instrument may also be useful for evaluating efficacy of foliar\nfungicides for control of foliar diseases. With the advent of relatively low-cost portable computers, the development of highly sophisticated data acquisition systems is feasible. The new equipment will permit accurate, rapid measurement of reflected solar\nradiation from field and test plots in several wavelengths.",

Information escrows allow people to transmit sensitive information to a trusted intermediary, an escrow agent, who only forwards the information under prespecified conditions. For example, an allegation escrow for sexual harassment might allow a victim to place a private complaint into escrow with instructions that the complaint be lodged with the proper authorities only if the escrow agent receives at least one additional allegation against the same individual. We assess the benefits and costs of allegation escrows and discuss how they might be applied to a variety of claims, including sexual harassment, date rape, adultery, and corporate and public whistle-blowing. We also show how analogous shared-interest escrows might be used in workplace dating and adoption contexts to facilitate the discovery of parties' mutual interest when unintermediated expressions of interest might themselves be harassing.",

As the capacity of traffic infrastructure\ncan only slowly be further increased, a much more efficient traffic management is necessary to mitigate the negative impacts of road traffic.\n\nThe aim of the CoVeL project is to develop and commercialize the Lane Navigation Assistant (LNA) - an in-vehicle device which will enable lane-level navigation and lane-level traffic management especially in urban areas. The LNA will use\nsatellite positioning as its primary source, whereas these data will be augmented by correction information coming from the EGNOS system. The EGNOS data will be obtained from EDAS and broadcasted to the vehicles using standard\nVehicle2Vehicl- / Vehicle2 -Infrastructure-communications, for which standards are under development. Furthermore, the satellite positioning will be enhanced by innovative algorithms for cooperative localization and map matching. The resulting\nlane-level vehicle positioning will bring navigation and traffic management to a new level of detail and effectiveness.",

This paper covers a study of the behavior characteristics of ortho versus para phthalate esters in PVC. It is demonstrated that terephthalate esters have a tendency to crystallize to solids. In order to produce liquid compounds, the alcohols need to contain considerable amount of branching. Also, the carbon length needs to be greater than 4 and less than 10; otherwise, volatility and incompatibility with PVC occurs. When a terephthalate ester is a liquid and compatible with PVC, distinct differences from the corresponding ortho phthalate ester are evident. These differences include: less volatility, better low temperature flexibility at equal hardness, lower plastisol viscosity, better plastisol viscosity stability, excellent electrical properties and superior nitrocellulose lacquer mar resistance. In general, the behavior characteristics of a terephthalate ester are similar to those of an ortho phthalate ester prepared from an alcohol with one additional carbon atom.",

The RI species lower the heat and temperatures required for flame front propagation. This enables combustion under leaner than otherwise feasible fuel-to-air ratios. Combustion under fuel leaner conditions lowers local and peak temperatures, thereby reducing NOx production. The presence of the RI species also increases combustion stability at the leaner fuel-to-air ratios. The study includes both experimental and simulation analysis components. For the experimental studies a single cylinder diesel test engine, modified to operate at an 11: 1 compression ratio with a spark plug, is used. The simulation analysis of this engine design involves the use of a full chemical-kinetics formulation based on 32 species and 97 chemical reactions. The equations for this formulation are solved simultaneously within both the mini and main chambers as the gas mixtures interact thermo-chemically and hydro-dynamically with themselves, with the internal cylinder chamber boundaries and with the manifold (exchanging energy, momentum, mass and\nchemical species). The study shows that, relative to the base line engine performance (without RI species), significant NOx reductions are accomplished without accompanying CO production trade offs. It also shows the effectiveness of the RI\nspecies in improving combustion stability while simultaneously enabling fuel leaner combustion.",

Periphery mounted secondary chambers enable the generation of these RI species in one cycle for use in the next cycle. These chambers are outfitted to enable fuel-insertion and rapid heat addition. The new technology examined in the study employs the chemistry of homogeneous combustion radical ignition (HCRI) for the RI species enhancement of pre-mixed charge (PC) SI. The aim is to see if this chemistry can increase the lean burn threshold of this 2-stroke engine with natural gas (NG). The analysis uses experimental data together with a full chemical-kinetics simulation formulation that also accounts for thermo-chemical and hydro-dynamic exchanges that are both between the chambers and with the environment. The mechanism for the chemical kinetics consists of 97 chemical reactions involving 33 species. The results suggest the potential for extending the experimentally successful 4-stroke RIS(A)-PCSI technology to 2-stroke SI engines for NOx reduction.",

This capability has been included in Microsoft Outlook since 2007 if not before.\n\nThe Microsoft technical article, Getting Started with VBA in Outlook 2010, clearly explains how to define and write macros for mail processing in Outlook. It should be noted that Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) is the programming language used for writing macros in all Microsoft products including Outlook. To quote the first paragraph in the article, \"The great power of VBA programming in Office 2010 is that nearly every operation that you can perform with a mouse, keyboard, or a dialog box can also be done by using VBA. Further, if it can be done once with VBA, it can be done just as easily one hundred times or one thousand times. (In fact, the automation of repetitive tasks is one of the most common uses of VBA in Office.)\"\n\nThe sections VBA Programming in Outlook 2010 and VBA Programming 101 give an overview of how a user can write a macro. The section Making Macros Accessible covers customizing the Quick Access Toolbar to expose the macros both on the toolbar and with keyboard shortcuts. The final major section covers a step by step guide for create a Contact Editing Macro.\n",

         "abstract":"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): According to the American diabetes\nAssociation, there are more than 16 million people in the United States with known\ndiabetes. Diabetic patients commonly demonstrate impaired wound healing.\nApproximately 20 percent of patients with diabetes will develop foot ulceration in their\nlifetime. Diabetic foot ulceration (DFU) represents a major problem that can\nsignificantly impair the patient's quality of life, require prolonged hospitalization, and\nmay involve infection, gangrene, and amputation. It has been estimated that for each\nnew foot ulcer the attributable cost for a middle-aged diabetic man in the first two years\nis approximately $ 30,000. The cost of DFU to the healthcare system is over one billion\ndollars per year in the United States. A well- established reason as to why diabetic\nwounds are tough to heal is that they do not progress through the normal healing phases.\nInstead, it is thought that diabetic wounds are caught and remain trapped in the initial\ninflammatory phase of wound healing. FirstString Research, Inc. (FSR) is a biotech\ncompany located in Charleston, South Carolina. The founders of FSR, Drs. Robert\nGourdie and Gautam Ghatnekar are co inventors of a class of novel bioengineered\npeptides - we refer to as ACT peptides. Based on our data from treatment of acute\nwounds as well as preliminary data from wound healing in diabetic C57BL/KsJm+/+\nLeptdb (db+/db+) mice, we believe that our lead compound, ACT1 peptide will\nhave beneficial effects in the treatment of chronic wounds such as DFU's. ACT1 peptide\nhas been shown to significantly dampen down the initial inflammatory response and\npromote faster and effective progression through wound healing. We hypothesize that\nACT1 peptide will provide a unique, mechanistically based approach to restoring\nnormal progression of wound healing in diabetics. Milestones for Phase I project: 1. To\ndetermine whether or not ACT1 peptide promotes wound healing, and reduces\ninflammation in diabetic C57BL/KsJ-m+/+Leptdb (db+/db+) mice. 2. To determine if\ntopically applied ACT1 peptide on skin wounds in diabetic C57BL/KsJ-m+/+Leptdb\n(db+/db+) mice has any systemic effects as evaluated by blood analyses and necropsy.\nPresent therapies and drugs for wound healing in diabetes and chronic wounds in\ngeneral are predominantly symptomatic, empirical, unpredictable, and largely\nineffective The ACT1 peptide potentially offers a mechanistically based solution to not\njust faster wound closure but also significant cost savings and more importantly\nimproving the quality of life in diabetic patients. The development of FSR's ACT1\npeptide via milestones outlined in this SBIR, not only will meet this specific need for\npatients and surgeons, but also has the potential to lay a platform for broader clinical\napplications and commercial opportunities.\n",

Although the reduction of protons to dihydrogen competes with methanol formation, methanol faradaic yields of up to 30% have been observed at hydrogenated Pd electrodes. The former takes place directly at the electrode surface and also by the reduction of the reduced pyridinium species to form pyridine and hydrogen. The outstanding feature of this system is that the reduction of CO2 proceeds at low overpotentials.",

A lower molding temperature was preferred to maximize the clarifying ability of ADV-1. The clarifier improved haze effectively and provided excellent transparency even at lower loading levels of around 0.1 wt%, and exhibited the superior clarity in thin molded articles. Higher stiffness of 25% increase in flexural modulus can be achieved by using the clarifier. Thus, ADV-1 gave an excellent balance between clarity and stiffness. A similar tendency was confirmed in PP film application. On the other hand, the haze of molded articles with the clarifier varied with a comonomer randomness referred as comonomer sequence distribution or run numbers. Polydispersity also affected the haze values. ADV-1 provided superior transparency when used with polypropylenes of higher randomness and a broader molecular weight distribution. This suggests that appropriate design of base resin in combination with the clarifier is essential for the design of superior clarified polypropylene grades. In summary, ADV-1 is expected to diversify the design of clarified polypropylene and to expand the application range for these grades.",

The standards are being developed with guidance from the HITIS Advisory Committee, with financial support from several industry organizations.\n\nThe hospitality industry has been challenged for years by the need to purchase and maintain complicated custom interface programs that support communications between disparate systems. An example of the type of inter-systems communication needed by hotels is the posting of charges to guest accounts from subsystems such as those supporting restaurant point-of-sale (POS), telephone call accounting, and in-room movies. Without interfaces, charges from these sub-systems must be manually re-keyed into the PMS, creating operational difficulties and affecting guest service. Other examples of interface applications include, but are not limited to: the transfer of room reservations from the CRS to the PMS; the transfer of group block information from the sales and catering system to the PMS; the transfer of time-clock \"punches\" to the payroll system; and the sharing of vendor files between purchasing and accounts payable systems.",

         "abstract":" Effective management of insect and mite vectors of plant pathogens is of crucial importance to minimize vector-borne diseases in crops. Pesticides play an important role in managing vector populations by reducing the number of individuals that can acquire and transmit a virus, thereby potentially lowering disease incidence. Certain insecticides exhibit properties other than lethal toxicity that affect feeding behaviours or otherwise interfere with virus transmission. To evaluate the potential of various treatments against the Bemisia tabaci-transmitted Cucurbit yellow stunting disorder virus (CYSDV), insecticide field trials were conducted in Yuma, AZ, USA, during spring and autumn growing seasons. Differences in vector-intensity each season led to mixed results, but at least five insecticide treatments showed promise in limiting virus spread during spring 2008. Increasing concern among growers in this region regarding recent epidemics of CYSDV is leading to more intensive use of insecticides that threatens to erupt into unmanageable resistance. Sustainability of insecticides is an important goal of pest management and more specifically resistance management, especially for some of the most notorious vector species such as B. tabaci and Myzus persiscae that are likely to develop resistance.",

A remarkable and unexpected property of the dried enzyme preparations is their ability to withstand prolonged exposure to temperatures as high as +70 degrees C. This stability is unique to trehalose and is not found with other sugars irrespective of their physical or chemical properties. The immediate significance of these observations is the ability to convert enzymes used in molecular biology into stable reagents. The indefinite stability and high temperature tolerance of these dried enzymes should permit the design of convenient formats that may be of particular significance in the automation of genome mapping and sequencing projects. The stabilization of a wide range of biomolecules by trehalose also has practical implications for a number of areas ranging from basic science, through healthcare and agriculture, to bio-electronics.",

Lateral jets set into the blades of the bit improve the cutter cleaning efficiency, thereby increasing the rate of production (ROP). In addition to cleaning the plenum in front of the jet, fluid entrainment creates a Venturi effect, drawing the fluid across the blades serviced by the downward jets. This flow is then ejected at high speed to the junk slots. The operators of the North Sea Scott field took a major initiative in this development, and in conjunction with the lateral-jet company, expanded the technology to initiate a new cutter design and the second generation of lateral-jet-type bits, the fully lateral-jet PDC drill bit. This paper will track the development of the technology from the initial trials of lateral jets in the Scott field, the rationale and design criteria that initiated oval PDC cutters, and most recently the fully lateral-jet bit.",

About 4,000 acres (1619 ha) are planted annually in Arkansas; most of this acreage is planted in late fall and harvested in the spring, a practice that helps to avoid the warmer soil temperatures that favor the incidence of fusarium decline caused by Fusarium oxysporum f sp. spinaceae (Bassi at al., 1987).\n\nThe main restraint in production of spinach in Arkansas is the incidence of diseases such as white rust, fusarium decline, blue mold, anthracnose, secondary anthracnose, cercospora leaf spot, phytophthora black rot, damping off, blight and tip burn (Goode et al., 1987; Bassi et al. 1978; Raabe and Pound, 1952; Dechmani and Goode, 1972). These diseases have caused severe losses to farmers and have also created unstability in the volume of canned spinach because of poor quality raw\nproduct.\n\nResearchers at the Main Experiment Station, Fayetteville, Arkansas, started a program in 1970 to develop varieties of spinach with resistance to the prevalent diseases in the production areas. As a result of -z this effort, three varieties of spinach have been released: 'Ozarka', 'Green Valley' and more recently 'Fall Green' (Bowers and Goode, 1980; Goode el al., 1987). The release of these varieties opens a new opportunity to increase the fall production of spinach. (These varieties are not recommended for overwinter and spring plantings because of their tendency to bolt early in the spring).\n",

         "abstract":"Spinach is arguably the #1 or # 2 most nutritious vegetable (broccoli being the other) that is consumed in the United States. It is very versatile since it is commonly used as a salad, a cooked vegetable or as a component of many other cooked meat and vegetable dishes. The recent development of baby leaf spinach coupled with an upswing of nutrition concerns has been responsible for increased consumption of spinach. It is widely stated that dark green leafy vegetables are the most lacking\ncomponent of the American diet. Spinach is one of the most desirable dark green leafy vegetables because it is high in beta carotene (pro vitamin A) and folate, and is also a good source of vitamin C, calcium, iron phosphorous, sodium and potassium\n(Ryder, 1979; Nonnicke, 1989; Dicoteau, 2000). It is high in the carotenoid lutein which has been shown to prevent age related macular degeneration. Spinach is a good source of antioxidants and has one of the highest ORAC (oxygen radical\nabsorbance capacity) values of any vegetable (Prior, 2003). While no attempts to breed for these traits have been reported in the literature there are reports of large differences between genotypes and it has been assumed that breeding for these traits\nis possible (Howard, 2001; Howard et al., 2002). Lutein values ranging from 10-25 mg/10g fresh weight have been reported (Murphy and Morelock, 2000). There also is a wide range of beta carotene levels between spinach genotypes (Murphy and\nMorelock, 2000). Moderate correlation between beta carotene content and lutein content has been reported (Murphy and Morelock, 2000; Murphy, 2001). Studies by Howard (2001) and Howard et al. (2002) have shown a wide variation in phenolic\ncompounds in both amount and relative distribution between genotypes. The highest levels of these compounds occurred in genotypes that were white rust resistant (Howard, 2001; Howard et. al., 2002) and this is probably related to their disease\nresistance.",

The glass\nindustry responded to the challenge by developing an assortment of coated and spectrally selective glass products which control, to\na known degree, the passage of visible light, infra-red heat energy and ultra violet energy into all structures. Insulating glass units\nutilizing warm-edge technology, special gas in the air space and special low-e coatings have greatly improved the ability of glass to\nkeep our buildings warmer in the winter and cooler in the summer.\n\nGlass allows the architect and engineer to design structures to get the full benefits of daylighting while -controlling heat transfer.\nThe glass industry has become a major energy conservation industry.\n\nGlass in windows, curtain walls and slylights produces important energy-saving benefits when properly designed and managed.\nThe use of daylighting in commercial buildings reduces the demand for artificial lighting. Artificial lighting is the largest single\nuser of energy in typical office buildings; daylighting is free, Energy costs to overcome heat gain and loss through glass are much\nless than for artificial lighting.' Arbitrarily limiting glass area to a small percentage of exterior wall or roof area can produce higher\noperating costs than larger well-designed and well-managed glass areas.\n\nGlass on sun-facing orientations of residences acts as passive solar collectors to offset a portion of winter heating costs. When\ndouble or triple glazing is used, especially in conjunction with a low-emissivity (low-e) coating, the net effect is energy\nconservation comparable to that of many opaque walls. When used with awnings, overhangs or indoor shading devices to reject\nsummer sun, windows can be even more energy efficient and cost-effective.",

The tensile properties of the subject blown films were observed to be significantly different from those of isotropic/un-oriented polyethylene specimens\nof similar density (crystallinity). Further, the tensile properties were different in the machine and transverse directions. These were explained in terms of the orientation\nand lamellar organization characteristics of the LLDPE blown films. Investigation of the temperature dependence (between -50 degrees C and +50 degrees C) of these tensile properties indicated an increase in modulus, yield stress and break stress with decreasing temperature pointing to the possible role played by the decreased mobility of the non-crystalline phase at lower temperatures. Excellent correlation between the Elmendorf tear properties of the LLDPE blown films and their tensile yield characteristics was observed. This added substantial credibility to previous hypotheses that specimen stretching plays a significant role in Elmendorf tear tests and further supported the previously identified structural features and microstructural deformation mechanisms that are deemed responsible for the discernment of LLDPE blown film tear resistance.",

Antimony and tin alloyed steels provide the best magnetic properties among the test steels and have bigger grain size than boron steel. The first group also has a higher fraction of (100)-fiber and a lower share of y fiber than the boron steel. However, the effects of these elements on textures with or without normalizing are minimal.

The automatic mould level control device is a NKK type; the mechanical oscillator works with the stroke adjusted within plus/minus5 mm and the oscillation frequency up to 500 cycles/min. Industrial trials have been performed by using a 140 t ladle from AOD-LF plants and a 180 t ladle from ASEA plant, as a function of steel grades cast. An advanced process control was developed through using the signals of 64 thermocouples embedded in the copper plates to monitor the mould local heat flux density, lubricating efficiency and, hence, early solidification behavior. Tests showed very satisfactory results as regards the slab surface quality of ferritic grade, either stainless or high Si steels, while the AISI 304 slabs surface is further to improve. From the preliminary hot and cold rolling tests, it can be envisaged that the strip surface quality is almost equivalent to the conventional products.",

An economic methodology was developed to predict the cost of service for hydrogen storage. This methodology was verified and tested on natural gas storage. Costs of service for\nhydrogen ranged from 26% to 150% of the cost of the gas stored.",

The system is equipped with several devices enabling a complete modelling of the movement of the system in the air, facilitating excellent high-resolution images of the subsurface. An integrated processing and inversion system for SkyTEM data is discussed. While the authors apply this system with SkyTEM data, most of the techniques are applicable for airborne electromagnetic data in general. Altitude data are processed using a simple recursive filtering technique that efficiently removes reflections from trees. The technique is completely general and can be used to filter altitude data from any airborne system. Raw voltage data that are influenced by electromagnetic coupling to man-made structures are culled from the dataset to avoid uncoupled data being distorted by coupled data, and geometrical corrections are applied to correct for pitch and roll of the transmitter frame. Data are de-spiked and averaged using trapezoid-shaped filter kernels. A Laterally Constrained Inversion using smooth models is actively used to evaluate the processing, and the final inversion is tightly connected to the processing procedures.",

To achieve this goal, we have designed a technique entirely based on image motion analysis. We perform the robust estimation of the dominant image motion assumed to be due to the camera motion. Then by considering the outliers to the estimated dominant motion, we can straightforwardly detect obstacles in order to assist car driving. We have added to the detection step a tracking module that also relies on a motion consistency criterion. Time-to-collision is then computed for each validated obstacle. We have thus developed an application-oriented solution which has proven accurate, reliable and efficient as demonstrated by experiments on numerous real situations.",

Plastic packaging derived from films, sheets and laminates is of importance in such discussions because of the number of items. Estimates show that about 100 billion packages made of plastic are produced annually and sold in Europe in stores after they are filled with food items. Their importance is constantly increasing. This is particularly so because the efficiency of packing material production (large surface area at low weight) is high and costs are thus relatively low compared with other packaging materials. Because of their low weight, films, sheets and laminates furthermore offer an interesting alternative. The VDI Packaging Forum\nnow addresses this challenging subject for the third time.\n\nThis time, we have selected the production of packaging and its processing on packaging machines as the main focus. On the one hand, the VDI Packaging Forum takes up subjects that are technically challenging to experts, but it also provides a global overview of packaging production and packaging strategy.\n",

To get high-strength fine pitch copper bonding wires, optimization of wire drawn procedure and optimized recrystallization annealing method are investigated. The microstructure and microtexture of bonding wires are analyzed by using Electron Back Scattered Diffraction (EBSD) and the relations between initial diameter of ingot and microtexture are revealed. Typical drawing and final annealing of copper bonding wires gives minor and major texture at 350 deg C and 450 deg C. Intermediate annealing before final diameter makes major and minor component with optimum grain size.\n",

Two iodine fractions, water-soluble and macromolecular fractions, were obtained using a sequential extraction scheme based on chemical reagents. Most iodine species separated from the water-soluble fraction with SEC-ICP-MS (mass range from 0.5 to 100 kDa) are present in inorganic forms (peak III), although the other two peaks were detected (peaks I and II). The application of AEC to the isolated peak III fraction allows the characterization of [IO.sub.3.sup.-] (about 25 %) and [I.sup.-] (about 75 %). The application of SEC-ICP-MS (mass range from 10 to 1200 kDa) to the macromolecular fraction reveals the presence of four peaks from the void volume to about 67 kDa, a peak is located about 600 kDa. The mass balance of iodine in the different fractions obtained from the microalgae raw stuff shows that the water-soluble fraction represents 66.7 % of total iodine in microalgae, but the macromolecular fraction only contains 13.3 %, both summing up for 79.9 % of the total amount of iodine, which confirms the suitability of the separation scheme. Further studies have to be focused on the purification of the isolated fractions and their identification by tandem MS.",

Polysaccharides and proteins from H. elongata caused a significant reduction in blood glucose 8 h after intravenous administration. A case of 5 mg/kg of crude polysaccharide lowered glycemia about 18% in normal rabbits and by about 50% in alloxan-diabetic animals, while the protein solution lowered glycemia in diabetic rabbits by about 30%.\n",

One technology a growing number of processors have slowly but steadily adopted is high-pressure pasteurization, a process giving processors the ability to market products with clean labels and a longer shelf life using a post-packaging food-safety intervention. While investing in the technology is typically a multi-million-dollar commitment, it's quickly become the norm in the ready-to-eat category and company's using HPP now include Tyson, Perdue   Farms, Hormel, Oscar Mayer and recently, Foster Farms.

Based on the fact that osteoclasts from p91-/- mutants (absence of the catalytic subunit of NADPH oxidase) generate normal amounts of superoxide, we have previously cloned an alternative form of p91 sub-unit, Nox4, which exhibits 58% similarity with the amino acid sequence of p91 subunit of the NADPH oxidase complex. This observation undermined that Nox4 oxidase derived superoxide is essential for osteoclastic function and activity. We have previously demonstrated that Nox4 is expressed in osteoclasts. Antisense oligos of Nox4 reduced superoxide generation and inhibited bone resorption in p91 knockout mice (Yang et al, 2001). To further study the physiological role of Nox4 in osteoclasts, we have generated RAW 264.7 cells that over express Nox4. A stable transfection technique was applied using the linear Nox4 expression cassette driven by the CMV promoter. After G418 selection, we have established four clonal cell lines (Nox4 RAW cells), which over express Nox4. RANKL stimulation induced osteoclast differentiation of Nox4 RAW cells similar to parental RAW cells. However, Nox4 RAW cells derived osteoclasts demonstrated two fold increase in superoxide production compared to osteoclasts derived from the parental RAW cells. Furthermore, Nox4 over-expression resulted in increased tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activity in osteoclasts compared to osteoclasts formed from control RAW cells. These data suggest Nox4 response to RANKL stimulation and its participation in superoxide production during osteoclast differentiation. Therefore, NADPH oxidase complex sub-unit, Nox4 play important role in osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption activity.\n",

Purified fractions from different species had the same general chemical composition, that of a typical sulphated homofucans, or fucoidan. The interaction of univalent and divalent counter-ions with fucoidan was investigated by viscometry and polarimetry, and by measuring the counter-ion activites and conductance coefficients in salt-free solutions. The activity and conductance coefficients were found to be independent of the polyanion concentration and approximately the same within each family of counter-ions. This indicates that cation binding in salt-free solutions of fucoidan is purely electrostatic. The conductivity results were in good agreement with the Manning's condensation polyelectrolyte model. The density charge parameter was 2.08 and the mean length of the monomeric unit was 4.5 Angstrom. Both the reduced viscosity and the optical rotation were dependent on the valency of the counter-ions used. Coupled with the data obtained from light-scattering measurements.",
